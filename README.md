# hello-world

Hello there!

I'm brand new to programming, and taking Harvard's CS50 as my introduction.
As of writing this, I just completed the problem set "Caesar" in week 2.
I figured I should better learn how to use Github so I can more easily share my code with all the lovely people who have offered to help me as I slam my face into the brick wall that is C.

If you are one of those people, and are reading this, thank you! <3
